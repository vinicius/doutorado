:: Relatório


: Review 1

- Explicitar mais o que já foi publicado e o que novo (talvez tirar mais conteúdo da parte inicial)

- Race conditions in UniCheck (there is not race conditions because we only treat regular and parametric applications?)

- What happens when the most advanced replicas goes down?
    DONE: "This mechanism works even when the most advanced replica crashes, as its last checkpoint remains stored at the Stable Storage so that the new
replica can resume from it."

- Compare the new mechanism with the previous-generation checkpointing approach

- investigate policy questions of how many replicas were optimal and what the optimal checkpointing strategies were


: Review 2

- the frequency and size of checkpoints and bandwidth

- how typical the test case is of other applications that the authors expect to be running


: Review 3

- title and the introduction. There are several paragrphs about mobile agents. But in section 4 and 5 there is nothing (?) about mobile agents

- section 1.1 does not tell to the reader the reader the real or specific contribution (section 4)

- term "down-time" or downtime?
    DONE: Term downtime is correct

- section 4, last paragraph: "... it require ..."
    DONE: Changed to "... it requires ..."

- section 5, references are missing at the first paragraph: "... mostly borrowed from []"
    DONE: References were placed

- section 5: downtime is fixed or follows some distribution? not clear
    DONE: It follows a distribution with fixed average. Text was corrected mentioning "average". 

- section 5: "... times(at least 34 ...)"
    DONE: space introducted between times and '(' 

- section 6: "The middleware make ..."
    DONE: Changed to "This middleware makes ..."


: Review 4

- good grammatical revision (help me Fabio :-)
- related work section seems to miss a relevant reference to Condor
- it could maybe fit in better if placed at the end of the paper, after the reader has understood the approach taken here
- "Several works present the use of mobile agents [...] but most of them present characteristics more related to the middleware, not the application"
- do not discsuss what exactly would be different if you tried to implement this approach in a different setting, without mobile agents
